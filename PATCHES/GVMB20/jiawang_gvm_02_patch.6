GVMB20 Patch Bundle 4 2014wk24 contains fixes for:

ABP-893		GVM 2.0 - GVMB should modify instead of delete/re-add 
		when user modifies SP2KX-properties.
Description:	When modifying MO SP2K it is deleted and then re-added. 
		This has been corrected to modify the properties.

ABP-1033	After upgrading GVM to 2.0, GVM can't get SBC's children.
Description:	During upgrades GVM  could not properly synch up SBC inventory. 
		An incorrect sql query has been corrected to resolve the issue.

ABP-1035	GVM fails to resync alarms on Genband Media Servers when 
		SNMPv3 (AuthPriv) configuration is used
Description:	Secure communication between SNMPv3 entities can not be provided
		correctly with the current implementation. A fix is delivered 
		to the Bean components of the high-level API 'SnmpTarget' used
		for current SNMPv3 operations. The implementation of the 
		remaining working operations is not changed.

ABP-1078	GVMB 2.0 Patch : Fix for Refreshable Collected Statistics Window
Description:	If GVM times out while the collecting statistic window opens, 
		the GVMB Gui becomes unresponsive. A fix to the 
		CollectedGraphViewer.java resolves the issue.

ABP-1061	R17 to R18 Upgrade: GVM failed to swact in split mode	
Description:	The issue is caused by performing the upgrade multiple times 
		using different GVMB 2.0.0 loads or patches: In this case, 
		the /opt/data/gvm/2.0.0/conf/update_conf.xml will contain a 
		wrong gvmb product version, which does not match the product 
		version in the run dir.  This miss match could cause some db 
		migration code to run twice. Some of the db migration code can 
		only be run once and will fail if run a second time. The fix is 
		to update the file /opt/data/gvm/2.0.0/conf/update_conf.xml 
		before calling the db migration tool, in gvmUpgradeTasks.sh

ABP-1093	Verizon KPI Exception seen	
Description:	When processing OMs for KPI calculation an execption occurs. 
		A fix is made to correct incorrect Casting. 

ABP-1091	GVMB specific problem ID mapping for MG9K is out of date
Description:	Over time the GVMB file which maps specific problem IDs 
		to string descriptions has become outdated. This fix brings 
		this file in line with whats mapped in the MG9KEM.

ABP-1086	SFTP connection re-use can cause collection jobs to fail
Description:	When GVMB collects OM files from the MG9KEM, it re-uses SFTP
		connections on a per NE basis. This can cause collection 
		to fail if: 
		1) 2 collection jobs at the same interval try to read 
		a file for the same NE at the same time OR 
		2) 2 collection jobs at different intervals (ex. 5 and 30min) 
		try to read OM files for the same NE at the same time. 
		This fix synchronizes connections for the same NE to 
		avoid this issue.

ABP-926		Java exception appears when modifying AS PM Jobs
Description:	A Java exception appears when modifying AS PM Jobs. 
		This exception has been corrected.

ABP-966		R18 OAM SV_Missing some information of Fault/Performance 
		interface mG9K on Web client
Description:	On the WebClient "subnet" information is not shown when viewing 
		Fault interface properties for MG9KEM and "mode" and "User ID" is 
		not shown under Performance.
